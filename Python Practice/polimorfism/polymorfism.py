'''
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, and it provides a way to use a single method name to perform different actions based on the object's type.

There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time (or static) polymorphism and runtime (or dynamic) polymorphism.

Compile-time Polymorphism:

Also known as method overloading.
Occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
The correct method is chosen at compile time based on the number and types of arguments passed.
Runtime Polymorphism:

Also known as method overriding.
Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
The correct method is chosen at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
